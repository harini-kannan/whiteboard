To start the server you must run src/server/Server.java. It will run the server on port 4444.
To start the client you must run src/client/Main.java with optional arguments [--host hostname] [--port PORT] which allows you to specify the HOSTNAME/IP and PORT address of the server.
If not specified, IP will default to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and PORT will default to 4444.
